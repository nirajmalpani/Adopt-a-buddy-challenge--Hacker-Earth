HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge: Adopt a buddy.

I have trained different model for pet_category and Breed_category.

Breed Category--
Here first Observation was the missing values of condition column has breed category 2.So,i have filled missing values with -1.
I have used Color_type feature for extraction more features from it and convert in numerical values.
Took the date , day ,month,year from listing and issue date columns.
Trained the model using Random Forest model.

Pet CAtegory--
Used the predicted breed category too from above.
USed simple imputer as it doesn't have a particular pattern like breed category for missing values.
I have used Color_type feature for extraction more features from it and convert in numerical values.
Took the date , day ,month,year from listing and issue date columns.
Trained the model using Xgboost model.
